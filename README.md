# Festival Sale Analysis

In this Project I did extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualisation on a datasetdataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics and uncover insightful patterns and trends. Here is an overview of the key findings and observations from the EDA:

## Data Quality
  Initially, I assessed the quality of the dataset by checking for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I performed necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.
  
 ## Data Distribution
  I visualized the distribution of variables using histograms, box plots, or density plots. This allowed me to understand the spread and shape of the data, identify skewness, and detect potential anomalies.
 
 ## Data Visualisation
   I created various visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, line plots, or geographic maps, to present the data in an intuitive and compelling manner. These visualizations helped identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers within the dataset.
   
   Overall, the EDA phase of this project provided valuable insights into the dataset, enabling informed decision-making and guiding subsequent steps such as feature engineering, modeling, or further analysis. The comprehensive exploration and understanding of the data set the foundation for successful outcomes and actionable recommendations.
